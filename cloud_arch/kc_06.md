# Question 1

### Which definition describes a **virtual private cloud (VPC)**?

**Options:**
- A virtual private network (VPN) in the AWS Cloud
- An extension of an on-premises network into Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- A logically isolated virtual network that you define in the AWS Cloud
- A fully managed service that extends the AWS Cloud to customer premises

**Answer:**
The definition that best describes a **virtual private cloud (VPC)** is: **A logically isolated virtual network that you define in the AWS Cloud**¹²³. VPCs allow you to create a private network within the AWS infrastructure, providing isolation and control over your resources.

A VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS
Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a
virtual network that you define. You have complete
control over your virtual networking environment.

# Question 2

### Which actions are best practices for designing a virtual private cloud (VPC)? (Select THREE.)

A. Match the size of the VPC Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block to the number of hosts that are required for a workload.
B. Use the same Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block as your on-premises network.
C. Divide the VPC network range evenly across all Availability Zones available.
D. Create one subnet per Availability Zone for each group of hosts that have unique routing requirements.
E. Reserve some address space for future use.

**Best Answers:**

A. Match the size of the VPC Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block to the number of hosts that are required for a workload.

D. Create one subnet per Availability Zone for each group of hosts that have unique routing requirements.

E. Reserve some address space for future use.

Incorrect
Using the same CIDR as an on-premises network might
cause routing issues if the two networks are connected
through AWS Direct Connect or a VPN. It is always a good
idea to provide enough addresses to accommodate
significant growth. Subnet CIDR blocks cannot overlap.

# Question 3

A company wants to run a highly available web tier by using two EC2 instances and a load balancer. Which design is valid and provides the highest availability?

A. One subnet in one Availability Zone. The subnet contains two EC2 instances.

B. One subnet, which spans two Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone contains one EC2 instance.

C. Two different subnets in the same Availability Zone. Each subnet contains one EC2 instance.

D. Two different subnets, one per Availability Zone. Each subnet contains one EC2 instance.

**Best Answer:**

D. Two different subnets, one per Availability Zone. Each subnet contains one EC2 instance.

# Question 4

A company's VPC has the CIDR block 172.16.0.0/21 (2048 addresses). It has two subnets (A and B). Each subnet must support 100 usable addresses now, but this number is expected to rise to at most 254 usable addresses soon. Which subnet addressing scheme meets the requirements and follows AWS best practices?

1. Subnet A: 172.16.0.0/25 (128 addresses), Subnet B: 172.16.0.128/25 (128 addresses)
2. Subnet A: 172.16.0.0/23 (512 addresses), Subnet B: 172.16.2.0/23 (512 addresses)
3. Subnet A: 172.16.0.0/22 (1024 addresses), Subnet B: 172.16.4.0/22 (1024 addresses)

The best answer is **Option 2**. This option provides each subnet with a /23 CIDR block, which supports up to 512 addresses. This is more than enough to support the current requirement of 100 addresses and the future requirement of 254 addresses. The other options either provide too few addresses (Option 1) or unnecessarily many addresses (Option 3), which is not efficient use of the address space. AWS best practices recommend using the smallest CIDR block that meets your needs, with room for growth.

Correct
These CIDR blocks are the next larger size from /24.
AWS reserves five addresses per subnet, so each
CIDR block has 507 usable addresses. This scheme
provides room for the growth requirement.

# Question 5

**Which combination of actions enables direct internet access for IPv4 hosts in a virtual private cloud (VPC)? (Select THREE.)**
1. Creating a route for 0.0.0.0/0 that points to the internet gateway
2. Creating a default route that points to the virtual private gateway
3. Configuring security groups and network access control lists (network ACLs) to permit internet traffic
4. Configuring hosts to have or obtain an internet-routable address
5. Enabling Domain Name System (DNS) resolution for the VPC
6. Configuring the VPC domain name in a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options set

**Best answers:**
1. Creating a route for 0.0.0.0/0 that points to the internet gateway
3. Configuring security groups and network access control lists (network ACLs) to permit internet traffic
4. Configuring hosts to have or obtain an internet-routable address

These actions enable direct internet access for IPv4 hosts in a VPC by setting up the necessary routing, allowing the necessary traffic, and ensuring the hosts have internet-routable addresses.

Correct
Hosts need internet-routable addresses that are obtained
statically, dynamically. or by address translation. The
default route is 0.0.0.0/0 and it must point to the
internet gateway. All traffic passes through security
groups and network ACLs which must allow the flow.

# Question 6

**A group of consultants requires access to an EC2 instance from the internet, for 3 consecutive days each week. The instance is shut down the rest of the week. The virtual private cloud (VPC) has internet access. How should you assign an IPv4 address to the instance to give the consultants access?**
1. Associate an Elastic IP address with the EC2 instance
2. Enable automatic address assignment for the subnet
3. Enable automatic address assignment for the EC2 instance
4. Assign the IP address in the operating system (OS) boot configuration

**Best answer:**
1. Associate an Elastic IP address with the EC2 instance

An Elastic IP address is a static, public IPv4 address, which is reachable over the Internet. If your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the internet. For example, you can associate an Elastic IP address to enable your consultants to connect to your instance from the internet. When the instance is stopped, the Elastic IP remains associated with it, to maintain the same IP address after the instance is restarted.

Correct
Using an Elastic IP address helps to ensure that the
instance has the same internet address.

# Question 7

**Several EC2 instances launch in a virtual private cloud (VPC) that has internet access. These instances should not be accessible from the internet, but they must be able to download updates from the internet. How should the instances launch?**
1. With Elastic IP addresses, in a subnet with a default route to an internet gateway
2. With public IP addresses, in a subnet with a default route to an internet gateway
3. Without public IP addresses, in a subnet with a default route to an internet gateway
4. Without public IP addresses, in a subnet with a default route to a network address translation (NAT) gateway

**Best answer:**
4. Without public IP addresses, in a subnet with a default route to a network address translation (NAT) gateway

A NAT gateway enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances. This is the most secure way to provide internet access to EC2 instances which need to download updates from the internet but should not be accessible from the internet.

Correct
A NAT gateway provides the EC2 instances with
internet-routable source addresses for sessions that
EC2 instances initiate. However, it does not enable
internet access to the instances.

# Question 8

**You are configuring a bastion host to access EC2 instances in a virtual private cloud (VPC). What must you do to the security groups? (Select TWO.)**
1. Add a rule to the bastion host to deny all traffic from the internet.
2. Add a rule to the bastion host to allow traffic from your source IP address.
3. Add a rule to the bastion host to allow return traffic to your source IP address.
4. Add a rule to the private subnet EC2 instances to allow traffic from the bastion host security group.
5. Add a rule to the private subnet EC2 instances to allow return traffic to the bastion host security group.

**Best answers:**
2. Add a rule to the bastion host to allow traffic from your source IP address.
4. Add a rule to the private subnet EC2 instances to allow traffic from the bastion host security group.

These actions ensure that the bastion host can receive necessary traffic from your source IP address and the EC2 instances in the private subnet can receive necessary traffic from the bastion host. This setup allows the bastion host to serve as a secure, controlled entry point to the EC2 instances in the VPC.

Correct
You must modify the security group of each instance to
allow traffic. Following the principle of least privilege the
security groups should limit traffic to only those systems
that need access. You can allow traffic to IP addresses
and other security groups.

# Question 9

You have a virtual private cloud (VPC) with a public subnet and a secure subnet. All EC2 instances in the secure subnet must be able to communicate with specific internet addresses. How can you control traffic with a network access control list (network ACL)?

1. Add rules to the default network ACL to allow traffic from and to allowed internet addresses.
2. Add rules to the default network ACL to allow traffic from and to allowed internet addresses.
3. Add rules to the subnet custom network ACL to allow traffic from and to allowed internet addresses.
4. Add rules to the subnet custom network ACL to allow traffic from and to allowed internet addresses.

**Best answer:**
3. Add rules to the subnet custom network ACL to allow traffic from and to allowed internet addresses.

By adding rules to the subnet's custom network ACL, you can control the traffic that is allowed to and from the EC2 instances in the secure subnet. This provides a higher level of security for the instances in the secure subnet. The implicit deny rule in the network ACL will automatically block all other traffic.

# Question 10

**All of the EC2 instances in a subnet can communicate with a certain IPv4 network on the internet. How should you modify the security groups or current custom network access control list (network ACL) to deny traffic to and from several restricted addresses in that network?**
1. In the network ACL, deny traffic to and from the restricted addresses.
2. In the security groups, deny traffic to and from the restricted addresses.
3. In the network ACL, allow traffic only to and from address ranges that exclude the restricted addresses.
4. In the security groups, allow traffic only to and from address ranges that exclude the restricted addresses.

**Best answer:**
1. In the network ACL, deny traffic to and from the restricted addresses.

Network ACLs are stateless, and they process rules in number order when deciding whether to allow traffic. You can create rules that deny traffic and rules that allow traffic. If there is no rule that explicitly allows a particular type of traffic, the traffic is implicitly denied. You can therefore deny traffic to and from specific IP addresses by adding rules to the network ACL. Security groups, on the other hand, are stateful and can only allow traffic. They cannot deny traffic. Therefore, you cannot use a security group to deny traffic to and from the restricted addresses.

Correct
This solution is the easiest way to deny traffic to and from
individual addresses You can specify the individual
address, or a range of addresses, to deny. These rules
should have lower rule numbers than rules that allow
traffic to and from the wider network.
