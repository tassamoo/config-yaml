Go in a nutshell:

1. Statically Typed Language
- Declared variable type explicitly or they have to be inferred
e.g:
var myVariable string //explicitly
var myVariable = "myString" //inferred

- Type cannot change afterwards without type conversion
e.g:
var n = 1 //if you declared n as 1 (number data type) on first line
var n = "one" //you cannot change it on second line (string data type)

2. Strongly Typed Language
